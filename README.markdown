A fun/hobby project fork of [ninjafire](https://github.com/lineupninja/ninjafire)

This currently requires a patched version of [firemock](https://forest-fire.gitbook.io/firemock) so will probably not build/pass locally.

Disclaimer, "ORM-all-the-things" can be an anti-pattern, I just happen to know ORMs well, so this is a good way for me to learn the pros/cons of what ORMs in particular, and the problem-space in general, of a Firebase/offline-first/mobile-first environment are.
